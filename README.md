# Iris Anticheat

### Why this is being released
Because Fozzie basically scammed me out of Iris, I decided for Christmas 2020 to open source Iris Anticheat. 

Here is how much Fozzie has worked on Iris compared to myself. (This is his first 3 months of contributions and it was mostly just string modifications and basic things or skidding):

### Can I use this?
If you want to use it for your own non-commercial purposes, 
you do not need to ask for permission as long as you provide the proper credits for each class you use. 

### What about for commercial use?
If you would like to re-sell a fork or implement code into a product that generates revenue, you must contact me first on Discord Dawson#7846 
or e-mail me at funkemunkybiz@gmail.com.
